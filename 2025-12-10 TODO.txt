I’ve looked over your `ParseListensV2.txt` and here’s what’s happening with that extra number on the left:

---

### 🔎 Why You See Two Numbers
When you call:

```python
f.write(df.to_string())
```

inside `save_report`, Pandas prints the DataFrame in its default “pretty” format. That format includes:

- **Row index** (the number on the far left: `28`, `214`, `16`).
- **Columns** (`artist`, `likes`).

So the “mystery number” is just the DataFrame’s index being displayed. It’s not another metric — it’s the row label.

---

### ✅ How to Remove the Index Column
You can tell Pandas not to include the index when converting to string:

```python
f.write(df.to_string(index=False))
```

That way, only the actual columns (`artist`, `likes`) will be written.

### ⚠️ Other Improvements / Expected Issues
1. **normalize_listens**  
   - You’re referencing `zip_path` inside `normalize_listens`, but `zip_path` isn’t passed in. That will raise a `NameError` if you run it directly.  
   👉 Fix: Add `zip_path` as a parameter:
   ```python
   def normalize_listens(listens, zip_path=None):
       ...
   ```
   And call it as:
   ```python
   df = normalize_listens(listens, zip_path)
   ```

2. **report_artists_with_likes**  
   - Currently counts *all liked listens*. If you want unique liked recordings per artist, replace `.size()` with `.nunique()`:
   ```python
   liked_listens.groupby("artist")["recording_mbid"].nunique()
   ```

3. **save_report**  
   - Right now you always write `.txt`. For CSV‑style reports (like your enriched genres), you’re manually writing rows. If you want consistency, you could use `df.to_csv(filepath, index=False)` instead of `to_string`.

4. **Genres lookup**  
   - MusicBrainz tags can be noisy. You may want to run them through your `normalize_genres` function before joining.

### 📊 Example Fix for Save Report
```python
def save_report(df, report_name, zip_path):
    base_dir = os.path.dirname(zip_path)
    reports_dir = os.path.join(base_dir, "reports")
    os.makedirs(reports_dir, exist_ok=True)

    timestamp = time.strftime("%Y%m%d-%H%M%S")
    filename = f"{report_name}_{timestamp}.txt"
    filepath = os.path.join(reports_dir, filename)
    
    with open(filepath, "w", encoding="utf-8") as f:
        f.write(f"=== {report_name} ===\n\n")
        f.write(df.to_string(index=False))  # 👈 suppress index
    
    print(f"Report saved to {filepath}")
```

---

✅ That will remove the “28 / 214 / 16” numbers and give you just:

```
artist                        likes
Between the Buried and Me      412
Rivers of Nihil                184
Animals as Leaders             148
```

Would you like me to also show you how to **merge the likes count into your enriched genre report** so each artist row has `Tracks, Hours, Genres, Likes` all together?
